Task Contract: harness-task v1

## Brief

One-line statement of the task objective and scope.

## Goal

Describe the verifiable result this task must produce, plus the deliverable's form and destination: what shape it takes, who receives it, where it lands, and who uses it first.

## Context

Record the input context and established facts. A cold-start agent must separate the three primitives first: task records what work is being done, fact records what has been observed, and decision records why a load-bearing choice holds.

## Required Reading

List concrete code, document, and contract paths in reading order, with an authority level for each item. Resolve source conflicts explicitly instead of presenting contradictory inputs as peers.

## Entry Conditions

List everything that must already be true before work starts. Stop and report when an entry condition is unmet instead of inventing missing upstream input.

## Dependencies

List upstream dependencies, handoff inputs, concurrent ownership, and downstream recipients, including how each dependency is proven ready.

## Execution Surface

Declare the repository, worktree, branch, base, and allowed write scope. The dispatcher injects the concrete absolute `cwd`; do not copy a machine-specific path into durable prose.

## Constraints

List the assumptions that must not be made and the boundaries that must not be crossed: which current state must stay unchanged, and which actions are off-limits without authorization (external and destructive actions are forbidden by default).

## Checkpoint

State when to stop and report or request a ruling: stop-on-hit conditions (out-of-scope changes, gate bypass, conflict with an existing ruling, blast radius beyond estimate) and planned report-back points (e.g. after breakdown, before opening a PR).

## CI/Gate Authority Stop Condition

If this task is not a CI/gate/governance task but requires modifying CI/gate authority surfaces to pass, stop implementation, record the blocker, and request or create a governance task. Explicit CI/gate/governance tasks and break-glass main recovery are the only exceptions; break-glass must record reason, scope, and a follow-up governance task.

## Implementation Plan

- Inspect existing code, documents, and contracts.
- Record key progress with `ha task progress append <task-id> --text "..." --evidence type:PATH:summary`.
- Explicitly promote load-bearing observations needed for later decisions or cross-task reasoning with `ha fact record --task <task-id> --statement "..." --source "..." --confidence high`; Facts remain `0..N`, while delivery evidence belongs in Execution outputs.
- For route choices, reversals, long-lived boundaries, or choices that derive follow-up work, run `ha decision propose ...`; when facts support decisions or decisions derive tasks, connect them with `ha decision relate ...`.
- Verify behavior with tests and checks.

## Deliverable Contract

State the deliverable shape, destination, recipient, first consumer, and every task-specific field that completion must submit or report. Do not duplicate generic Worker discipline here.

## Evidence Protocol

State the required evidence granularity, negative controls or mutation checks, and reviewer rejection conditions. This section defines how to prove the result; `Verification` defines what must be true.

Close the loop before closeout: record at least one observation with `ha fact record --task <task-id> ...` and preserve its receipt in the Execution outputs. A fact is an evidence input to a decision, so attach it to the relevant claim with `ha decision relate <decision-id> --anchor <claim-id> --type evidenced-by --target fact/F-XXXXXXXX --rationale "<why>"` before accepting or reckoning that decision. If a proposal has no fact evidence yet, `ha decision propose` still succeeds, but its receipt points to these two commands.

## Verification

- **Stop point = `node tools/run-manifest-gates.mjs --changed origin/main` green + targeted tests for the surface you touched green + a local commit. The full gate matrix is GitHub CI's job, not this machine's.** The command derives cheap deterministic checks from the gate manifest's `localPathGlobs`; do not replace it with a second checklist. Name the specific test files this task's surface requires and paste real runner output rather than writing "all green". `npm run check:ci` remains available for deliberately reproducing a CI failure locally; it is not the stop point.
- The remaining targeted set is fixed: (1) affected integration files through `node tools/dispatch-isolated-test.mjs --file <path>`; (2) `git grep` every error code, message text, and protocol field name changed, then run the consumer tests found in other packages.
- List any review and human acceptance conditions this task additionally requires.
- Under the default completion contract, record at least one fact: `code-doc-reconciliation` rejects completion without one as `fact_missing`; verify delivery through Execution outputs, review, closeout, and every applicable completion gate.
